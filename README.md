Motion detector that resets a countdown clock with a visual queue.  

This tool is based on a family bedtime routine where I agree to give my child more time on an activity of their choosing if they can lay in their bed, quiet and still for a specific amount of time.  The time may vary depending on the kid so I need the ability to set the countdown at various times.  

Basic concept is to use a motion detector to detect movement.  If the child moves, a red LED display will indicate the resetting of the countdown to the agreed upon time.  The countdown clock should be visible to the parent, but not the child; this will prevent the child from using the clock as a tool to focus on to stay awake.
